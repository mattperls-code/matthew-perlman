                <div>
                Hello, my name is Matt, and I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science at UMass Amherst.
                <br /><br />
                I love to program and am very passionate about computer graphics, robotics, and machine learning. I've been writing code for about 8 years now and I'm an adept problem solver across many fields. I've written parsers, neural networks, programming languages, and rendering engines all from scratch in C++ as well as award winning websites, chrome extensions, and mobiles apps using JavaScript and React.
                <br /><br />
                I've released several iOS mobile apps, done some professional freelance web development over the years, and am a founding member and the CTO of ClearContext, an AI powered tool to help identify and eliminate bias in online media.
                <br /><br />
                As a high schooler, I was the lead programmer and a driver for our FRC team, the Robolancers, and won the world championship in 2024. My two years of leadership on our 50+ person team taught me valuable soft skills about work management, delegation, dev ops, and communication as well as important technical skills like computer vision, control theory, and autonomous planning.
                <br /><br />
                I love building interesting and innovative projects, and am always looking for something new to learn about. Please reach out with any questions or ideas!

                        In 2023, my second year as a programmer on the RoboLancers, I was elected programming lead.
                        This meant I was in charge of delivering functional robot code, managing my team of 10+ programmers, and communicating with mechnical, CAD, and electrical leads.
                        <br /><br />
                        I oversaw the development of our robot that year, helping my programmers implement complicated PID controllers for the robot's arm and self balancing, inverse kinematics for joint angles, computer vision and odometry for feedback, and autonomous path following.
                        <br /><br />
                        While our end robot wasn't perfect that season, our team learned a lot and I had carved out a strong team of programmers for next year.
                        <br /><br />
                        In 2024, I maintained my position as the lead programmer, and my team shrunk to 5-10 strong programmers.
                        <br /><br />
                        Before our main season began, I led our team through building a scouting suite, Lancer Scout, which we later used for strategy in competitions.
                        <br /><br />
                        When the main season arrived, I managed our team as we built an automatic object collector using vision, automatic scoring, and complex multistep autonomous path following procedures.
                        <br /><br />
                        With a sharp team of engineers and programmers and a ton of luck, we ultimately made it to the World Championship and won.

                        I joined the RoboLancers as a freshman in 2020 during covid. Because of the pandemic, a lot of the roles were fuzzy and I wasn't officially a programmer for the team until 2021.
                        <br /><br />
                        In 2021, I skipped our school's FTC team and jumped directly into FRC (think skipping JV for Varsity if you aren't familiar with FIRST).
                        <br /><br />
                        While there, I was introduced to a team of returning programmers and given the task of finding some way to help contribute to the team's robot.
                        It didn't take me long to find something I wanted to build, and I immediately began working on an automatic shooter and vision system for our team's dodgeball-style robot.
                        After finishing the shooting, I helped some of my other teammates program the climbing mechanism, autonomous motion paths, and controls.
                        <br /><br />
                        By the end of the year, I had taught myself most of the framework we were using, learned how to use vision data, and was in charge of tuning most of our motor PIDs.

                        The shooter dynamically adjusts its angle and speed to hit variable distance shots automatically based on visual cues.

                        To control this very heavy machinary, we used custom PID on all the arm motors as well as inverse kinematics to determine joint angles.
                        It also uses a vision pipeline combined with odometry to follow complex autonomous motion paths.

                        A powerful toolkit for evaluating, analyzing, and converting finite automata and regular expressions.
                        <br /><br />
                        The FiniteAutomata class can compare different languages, evaluate strings for membership, and convert between various subtypes of finite automata and regular expression.
                        These conversions include transitions between literal expression strings, regular expressions, lambda NFAs, NFAs, DFAs, and min DFAs.
                        The project also supports multiple export options, allowing for easy integration with LaTex, PDFs, and images.

                        The original mobile app used React Native bluetooth protocols to send the same data that is now compressed in QR format, but we have since moved to visual data tranfer for convenience.

                            I've been using HTML and CSS for web development for around 8 years.
                            <br /><br />
                            Most of my earlier projects were web related, and I've accumulated a lot of experience over the years working with HTML and CSS.
                            I'm familiar with a vast amount of tags and styles, and know the ins and outs of these languages.
                            <br /><br />
                            I've built websites for fun, professionally as a freelancer, and won design competitions.
                            <br /><br />
                            While frontend is not my passion the way it was as a beginner, I often find these skills helping me out in various projects.

                            <br /><br />
                            I find the theory incredibly fascinating and have enjoyed learning about the math and concepts behind things like neural networks, large language models, and image classification.
                            <br /><br />
                            I recently decided to put my knowledge to the test, and built a neural network and convolutional neural network by hand.
                            The projects ended up being very complicated but also very rewarding, and I hope to continue this kind of work in the future through personal or career research.

                            I first encountered Formal Language Theory accidently while building the parser for programming language, Platinum.
                            I didn't take the full dive then, but when it came up again in my discrete math class, I decided to really explore grammar and parsing.
                            <br /><br />
                            I built out a parser combinator library for fun, and then a finite automata project using what I was learning in my class.
                            <br /><br />
                            I find Formal Language Theory to be a really intriguing field, and I'm interested in exploring further in the future, potentially with context sensitive grammars.

                            As every programmer does, I first ran into Regular Expressions by chance, and for a long time it was just a tool I knew existed.
                            <br /><br />
                            When I took my first discrete math class though, I learned how they actually work, and demystified them for myself.
                            When I started building my finite automata project, I decided I wanted regular expression conversions too, so I implemented tools for parsing, evaluating, and comparing them.
                            <br /><br />
                            I haven't used regular expressions too much in practice, but I hope to eventually get more practical experience using them in the future.

                            My first introduction to parsing was when I was building my programming language, Platinum.
                            Because I wrote Platinum without any libraries or assistance, I sort of "figure out" how to do the parsing myself, which ultimately results in what I now know to be loosely a left lookahead parser.
                            <br /><br />
                            My friend later introduced me to the concept of parser combinators and other functional approaches to parsing, and this inspired me to implement those tools for myself.

                            Practically, I've used existing image classifiers and object detection methods for localization and automation in robotics.

                            <br /><br />
                            I first started programming with the intent to build games, so naturally I quickly fell into the world of 2D and 3D graphics.
                            <br /><br />
                            As a middleschooler, I learned how perspective projection, ray tracing, ray casting, rasterization, and other common techniques worked.
                            As I became a better programmer, I put this knowledge into practice and built various types of renderers.
                            <br /><br />
                            I still love making graphics projects, and I'm a firm believer that graphics is the ideal place for new programmers to start their journey.

                            Apart from the projects listed here, I have two unhosted extensions stored on my github, UClass and Students in Style.

                            From my two years as programming lead on the RoboLancers, I gained a huge amount of experience as a leader.
                            <br /><br />
                            On the RoboLancers, I managed a team of 5-10 programmers working under me inside of a larger 50+ person team of other engineers, electricians, and modelers.
                            <br /><br />
                            This role taught me how to delegate work effectively, keep track of deadlines, ensure clear communication between myself, my other programmers, and the other leads, and keep a focused long term goal.

                            Software Engineering is a broad term, so I'll clarify it to mean building projects where clean coherent code structure is essential.
                            <br /><br />
                            I've built tons of large scale projects both as a solo developer and on a team. In many of these projects, making clean decisions in codebase architecture was crucial.
                            <br /><br />
                            Across these projects, I've learned how to write clean code that reads like instructions, make meaningful abstractions, segment code and functionality, and keep clear stylistic conventions.

                            Anyone who started programming as a hobbyist knows that working on a team is a different experience.
                            <br /><br />
                            For me, my first two or so years programming had been solo. By joining a team during high school, it pushed me to develop better soft skills and effectively communicate with other programmers as well as people who don't write code.
                            <br /><br />
                            By spending four years in this environment, I became a strong communicator capable of interacting with technical and non-technical teammates to deliver the best end result possible.
